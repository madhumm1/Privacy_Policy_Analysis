# Privacy_Policy_Analysis_For_User_Awareness
The purpose of this project is to create a website that aims to educate users about privacy policies and encourage them to read these policies by testing their knowledge through a set of questions with multiple choice options. The website will provide users with specific information and that relate to the questions they answered. The website is designed to be clear and easy to understand, and to comply with relevant privacy laws and regulations. This project can help users gain a better understanding of privacy policies and the potential risks associated with not reading them and promote privacy awareness among internet users.
